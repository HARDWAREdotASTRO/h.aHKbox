Proto type of GUI as of August 12th 2021 
Currently trying to add a download log button that will log the data and time in a csv file. when it comes to adding this to the h.ahk box this may need to be changed to a text
file instead of cvs. 
Currently the download buttons works but doesn't have any data in it when its downloaded. Data only works when its combined in the live graph function however, it wants to download a new CSV files every second which is not what I'm looking for. I'm trying to figure out how to make the values in the time and Y access for available outside the live graph function
the graph also needs to be stylized and organized a little bit as well.
graph needs more tabs (up to 10 for each card) these tabs needs to be hidden when cards are not available or not plugged into the h.ahk box. and the tabs that are available need their sizes to adjust automatically. 
currently the check boxes, tabs and dropdown boxes don't do anything the 4 tabs contains the check box and drop down but not the.
once done then the API and firmware need to work with this GUI everything is in python so everything should be in the same language.

also just to specify the value in file name '081021' is refering to the date the file was created '08-10-21' it was edited since then.
