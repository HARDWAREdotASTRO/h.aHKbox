This project was presented in progress at the 235th AAS confernece in Honolulu, HI in January of 2020. The submitted abstract for this presentation can be found here: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AAS...23517507S/abstract

# H.aHkBox
The Hardware.astronomy Housekeeping Box (H.aHkBox) is an open source modular platform originally designed for the monitoring and control of temperatures on the ZEUS2 grating spectrometer. I began working on this project under the direction of Dr. Carl Ferkinhoff in May of 2019 and continue to do so (Dec 2020). 

Additional information about ZEUS2 can be found here: http://hosting.astro.cornell.edu/~spifiweb/zeus2/index.html

Additional information about the H.aHkBox will be made available on OSF in the future.

## Motivations
Existing temperature control equipment for the ZEUS2 is limited for various reasons. Chief among them are:
  - Obsolete components that cannot be replaced if/when they break
  - Temperature reading rate is limited by hardware multiplexer
  - System is dependent on external PC
  
The H.aHkBox is an attempt to solve these issues while providing a versatile platform for future growth of ZEUS2 and other projects.



## Specific Goals
  - [X] Design and build the chassis 
  - [X] Design and build a prototyping modular card
  - [ ] Design and build the backplane of the system [in progress]
  - [ ] Design and program an operating system (H.aHkOS) and supporting libraries [in progress]
  - [ ] Design and build ZEUS2 specific modular cards [in progress]

See h.aHKbox\Chassis\Presentation\Presentation\December 2020\ for a presentation detailing the process and current state of the project.
