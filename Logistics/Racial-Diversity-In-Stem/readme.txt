On June 10th 2020 non-essential STEM workers carried out a work strike to support the ongoing movements seeking to end systemic racism in the US. Racism and other biases are clearly an issus in the US but rarely does a large scale discussion focus on particular work fields. Personally, I've certainly noticed racial and gender based biases throughout my Computer Science and Physics academic pursuits, but I've never applied that perspective towards STEM as a whole, beyond gender. To support the current movement and those affected by it I spent some time graphing racial and gender diversity data in STEM. This data was from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and this is 2019 data. The entirety of the workforce diversity statistics should be found in this folder but I tried to exclusively looking at STEM. I can't promise my data selection is exclusively STEM or fully inclusive of STEM, but I did my best in selecting fields. If anyone wants to talk about this data, the resulting graphs, or anything related to biases in or out of STEM, by all means I'd love to. I have plenty more to learn regarding these biases, but that's one of the reasons we talk about it. #BlackLivesMatter #ShutDownAcademia #ShutDownSTEM
